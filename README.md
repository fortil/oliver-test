## Improvement to do
- I would like to organice the code
- I would like to improve the UI in:
    - Header
    - Cards
    - Form
    - Buttons
- I would like to create the tests

## Running the app
Start the mock JSON server on port 3004 using `json-server --watch db.json`
Start the React app on port 3000 using `npm start`
You can then make requests to http://localhost:3004/products, http://localhost:3004/reviews or http://localhost:3004/products/:id/reviews using axios, or any of your preferred methods

More info on json-server [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
